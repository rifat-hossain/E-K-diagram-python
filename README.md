# E-K Diagram (python)
An E-K diagram, also known as an Energy-Momentum diagram, is a graphical representation often used in condensed matter physics to describe the energy and momentum of electrons in a crystalline solid. It helps in understanding the electronic band structure of materials, especially semiconductors and insulators.

E-K diagram varies with the pattern of the potential barrier. If the electron is in a free space (no barriers) then it has a specific behaviour (E-K_free_space.ipynb). On the other hand, if the electron is in a one dementional periodic potential barrier then its behaviour can be studied from Kronig Penny model (Ek_using_kp_model.ipynb).
